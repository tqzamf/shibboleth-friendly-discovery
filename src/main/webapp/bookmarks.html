<h1>Bookmarking Shibboleth Login Pages</h1>
<h3>Short Version</h3>
<p><b>Don't do it.</b> Your bookmarks will stop working after a short while.</p>

<h3>Long Version</h3>
<p>Shibboleth login depends on a particular sequence of operations,
some of which happen before you even get to see the password entry page.
Thus if you try to bookmark the password entry page,
for example using <i>Bookmark this page</i> in the bookmarks menu,
your bookmark will at best work for a few minutes before it stops working.
In most cases, such a bookmark will never work in the first place.</p>

<p>It is usually possible, however,
to create bookmarks that take you to the password entry page if necessary,
or directly to the service if you are already logged in.
The login process tells you when this is possible
by showing the <i>How to bookmark these links</i> notice
above the list of institutions.
Thus the procedure for creating such a bookmark is as follows.</p>

<ol>
<li>Verify that the page shows the <i>How to bookmark these links</i> notice.
	If it <b>doesn't show anything</b>, or shows <i>Do not bookmark these links!</i>,
	then the links that are shown <b>cannot be bookmarked</b> successfully.</li>
<li>Right-click the desired institution and choose <i>Bookmark This Link</i>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Such bookmarks will generally work for a long time,
and may be worth the effort if you log into a service very frequently.
Nevertheless, there are some rare situations where they will break
and you will have to recreate them.</p>
